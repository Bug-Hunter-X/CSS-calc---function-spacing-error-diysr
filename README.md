# CSS `calc()` Function Spacing Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the CSS `calc()` function and provides a solution.

## The Bug
The bug lies in the incorrect use of the `calc()` function.  When combining percentages and pixels, proper spacing (spaces) between operators and values is crucial for the calculation to work correctly. Missing these spaces leads to unexpected layout issues.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that there are spaces between the operators (+, -, *, /) and the values (percentages and pixels) within the `calc()` function.
